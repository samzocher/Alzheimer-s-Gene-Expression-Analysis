# Alzheimer-s-Gene-Expression-Analysis
This project utilized genetic data from the an Alzheimer's Disease Study (Blalock et al 2011). I compared differentially expressed genes in subjects with incipient Alzheimer's Disease (AD) to subjects with moderate AD. Additionally, moderate AD vs severe AD was investigated.
